# Kore Ledger Contract

In Kore Ledger, each **subject** is associated with a schema that fundamentally determines its properties. The value of these properties may change over time through the emission of **event**s, being necessary, consequently, to establish the mechanism through which these events perform such action. In practice, this is managed through a series of rules constituting a **contract**.

The contract is a set of rules that define the behavior of a subject. It is composed of a set of **conditions** and **actions**. The conditions are the rules that must be met for the actions to be executed. The actions are the rules that are executed when the conditions are met.
