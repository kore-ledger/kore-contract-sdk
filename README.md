# Kore Ledger Contract SDK

This repository contains the **Kore Ledger Contract SDK** (Software Development Kit). It is a library that must be used to build the logic that directs the life cycle of the **subjects** through the events that modify said life cycle. Consequently, we can say that a **subject schema** always has an associated **contract** that regulates how it evolves. The specification of both is done in **governance**.
